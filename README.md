## Purpose

This is a playbook to set up a pptools server.

Based on https://github.com/tangledhelix/pptools/

## Assumptions

- Ubuntu 22.04 or later.
- This was built on Digital Ocean - assumes root login by default.

## Server migration

May want to copy the temporary projects area? Would be less disruptive for users.

```
/opt/pptools/wsgi/projects/
```
